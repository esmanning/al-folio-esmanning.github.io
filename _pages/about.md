### personal note

I created this website as a grad student, because it's normal in academia to have one. Once I moved to industry in 2021, it became less relevant, and some parts of the site have not been updated since then. Maybe I'll do it someday.

In January 2025, I finally decided to delete my old and rarely-used Facebook and Twitter accounts. My big concern in doing so is that old friends I was in contact with only through those sites (Facebook in particular) may no longer know how to find me. If you're such a person and you searched for me and found this site, hello! My contact info provided below should be reasonably up to date; please reach out by email or one of the other options, and if appropriate I can then give you more options to contact me.

### more professional stuff

I'm a Computational Linguist, passionate about data annotation and evaluation methods. I'm currently working as a Research Scientist doing "Responsible AI" evaluation for a tech company that you've heard of, but that I can't name publicly because I work for them via a vendor company. Before that, from 2021-2023, I worked as a Linguist at Google.

I got a PhD in Computational Linguistics at Georgetown University in 2021.
[Nathan Schneider](http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/nschneid/) was my advisor, and I was a member of [NERT](http://nert.georgetown.edu/) and [GUCL](http://gucl.georgetown.edu/).

### referring to me

My name is Emma for professional purposes, including on publications. I pronounce my name /ˈɛmə ˈmænɪŋ/. I'm perfectly happy to be called Emma informally as well; some people also know me by nicknames like Ember of Epsilon.

When referring to me with [third-person pronouns](https://kconrod.medium.com/pronouns-101-introduction-to-your-loved-ones-new-pronouns-3fef080266d0) in English, please use either he/him or they/them. If you're talking about me in a language other than English that marks gender grammatically, any non-feminine forms are fine.
