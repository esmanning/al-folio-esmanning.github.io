Since early 2020, cross-stitching has been one of my main hobbies. It helps me focus during talks and meetings, so if you're in a video call with me where I seem to be looking away from the camera a lot, this is what I'm doing!

My largest project took from November 2020 to April 2022. Here it is, with some progress photos:

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/gardenfinished.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt=""/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    My cross-stitch garden, completed.

<div class="row">

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

And here are some of my previous projects:
